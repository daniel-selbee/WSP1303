				<h2>Site Intent</h2>
					<p>
					The intent of the newly redesigned site can be broken down into _ categories. Cleaning up the code is one of the most important priorities
					of redesigning the site. The second is utilizing Gestalt principles in the site, especially in the text elements.
					  The third priority will be the performance of the site. The site contains unnecessary elements that slow down its loading times 
					  even though the site is extremely simple. The site's graphic optimization needs to be significantly reworked to accomplish this. Next is implementing forms directly
					 into the site so that clients do not have to print documents, fill them out, and turn them into the veterinary office. From experience,
					 I know that veterinary clinics must keep records for at least 7 years. This would be so much easier if this data were stored on the
					 computer. The last category is responsiveness. Many people use their mobile devices when trying to find a business. Since this is
					 a hospital, it is even more important that people are able to find the business quickly from their mobile devices.
					</p>
					<h3>Code</h3>
					<p>
					Reworking the code is not going to be a simple task. Much of the site contains unnecessary java elements that can be replaced by CSS.
					Replacing these elements will resolve some of the performance issues, but not all of them. The site has 5 errors while validating that
					I plan to fix. I expected many more when I entered it into the validation site. The code is also older. HTML 5 and CSS3 would greatly
					benefit this site. The final aspect to correct is the spacing and indentation issues. The code is very hard to read through efficiently.
					</p>
					<h3>Gestalt Principles</h3>
					<p>
					The five Gestalt principles that I am going to focus on are similarity, proximity, continuity, and closure. I need to change most of these elements
					in this site. I'll start with similarity. As I clicked through the separate links, a red flag went off. The pages looked different!
					I would fix this with simple design elements that tie together with proximity. Each page would contain this style of aesthetics. The other
					thing that is lacking is continuity. The eye jumps all over the page making it confusing for the user at first. I will fix this with a top-left
					approach. The heading will stick out, drawing the eye there. For closure, I am going to create boxes for different subjects that don't
					quite touch, but have a good proximity.

				<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
					<p>
					When thinking about a website's user, it's common to over-generalize who is 
					visiting the site. The more narrow the target, the more efficiently (and oftentimes more correctly)
					decisions are made. Providing the client with Use Case Scenarios where two or more types of users 
					are identified and a specific user-workflow is described is one way to lay the groundwork for Ui decision making.
					</p>
					<p>
					In a paragraph, or two, describe the targeted user group(s) and what you would expect their potential 
					needs/workflow would be.

				<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>When looking to gain market share, it is wise to analyze the competition and embrace (or learn from) their experience.
						 Are they drawing in a demographic you would like to tap into? Are visitors spending more time in their site's pages than yours?
						 Are they using keywords that you should be target as well? And, of course, any of the bad practices that are holding them back
						 are great lessons learned for you.</li>
						 <li>Competitor information, such as: site statistics, demographics, and keyword strategies, may be discovered utilizing 
						 the provided tools (properly citing sources as necessary).</li>
						 <li>Write a paragraph that summarizing your analysis of our client's competition.</li>
