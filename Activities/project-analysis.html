				<h2>Site Intent</h2>
					<p>
					Cleaning up the code is one of the most important priorities
					of redesigning the site. The second is utilizing Gestalt principles in the site, especially in the text elements.
					  The third priority will be the performance of the site. The site contains unnecessary elements that slow down its loading times 
					  even though the site is extremely simple. The site's graphic optimization needs to be significantly reworked to accomplish this. Next is implementing forms directly
					 into the site so that clients do not have to print documents, fill them out, and turn them into the veterinary office. From experience,
					 I know that veterinary clinics must keep records for at least 7 years. This would be so much easier if this data were stored on the
					 computer. The last category is responsiveness. Many people use their mobile devices when trying to find a business. Since this is
					 a hospital, it is even more important that people are able to find the business quickly from their mobile devices.
					</p>
					<h3>Code</h3>
					<p>
					Reworking the code is not going to be a simple task. Much of the site contains unnecessary java elements that can be replaced by CSS.
					Replacing these elements will resolve some of the performance issues, but not all of them. The site has 5 errors while validating that
					I plan to fix. I expected many more when I entered it into the validation site. The code is also older. HTML 5 and CSS3 would greatly
					benefit this site. The final aspect to correct is the spacing and indentation issues. The code is very hard to read through efficiently.
					</p>
					<h3>Gestalt Principles</h3>
					<p>
					The five Gestalt principles that I am going to focus on are similarity, proximity, continuity, and closure. I need to change most of these elements
					in this site. I'll start with similarity. As I clicked through the separate links, a red flag went off. The pages looked different!
					I would fix this with simple design elements that tie together with proximity. Each page would contain this style of aesthetics. The other
					thing that is lacking is continuity. The eye jumps all over the page making it confusing for the user at first. I will fix this with a top-left
					approach. The heading will stick out, drawing the eye there. For closure, I am going to create boxes for different subjects that don't
					quite touch, but have a good proximity.
					</p>
					<h3>Performance and Image Optimization</h3>
					<p>
					I think much of the performance issues come from the embedded javascript. The slideshows are unnecessary and are much too small
					when compared to other elements. I think this could be replaced by a gallery page or even a CSS slideshow that is clickable and
					doesn't play automatically. The images in the site need to be optimized for responsiveness. For example, I will retrace the logo
					with the pen tool in AI and make it a PNG so it can scale for larger monitors. It looks very pixelated on my 27" iMac.
					</p>
					<h3>Integrated Forms</h3>
					<p>
					The current site tries to encourage its prospective clients to print off and bring in forms to the veterinary clinic for processing.
					I will improve this process by building HTML forms that the clients can fill out online so they can be stored in the computer. This
					will make it easier on the clients and the veterinary clinic to keep track of the forms. This registration process also allows
					the receptionist to look up the new clients instantly and schedule appointments without having to input forms.
					</p>
					<h3>Responsiveness</h3>
					<p>
					Responsiveness is a very important aspect of this site. As I stated in the introductory paragraph, it is vital that clients are
					able to access the site from their mobile devices to find the veterinary hospital in an emergency. It is also a great way for
					people to just find a new veterinary clinic if they aren't happy with their current vet, or if they currently don't have a
					vet.

				<!-- START TARGET AUDIENCE -->
				<section class="targetedAudience">
				<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
					<h3>Profile</h3>
					Alexa.com wasn't able to gather enough data to put together a typical client profile so I had to do a little research.
					 
					<h3>Other User Groups</h3>
					<p>
					When thinking about a website's user, it's common to over-generalize who is 
					visiting the site. The more narrow the target, the more efficiently (and oftentimes more correctly)
					decisions are made. Providing the client with Use Case Scenarios where two or more types of users 
					are identified and a specific user-workflow is described is one way to lay the groundwork for Ui decision making.
					</p>
					<p>
					In a paragraph, or two, describe the targeted user group(s) and what you would expect their potential 
					needs/workflow would be.

				<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>When looking to gain market share, it is wise to analyze the competition and embrace (or learn from) their experience.
						 Are they drawing in a demographic you would like to tap into? Are visitors spending more time in their site's pages than yours?
						 Are they using keywords that you should be target as well? And, of course, any of the bad practices that are holding them back
						 are great lessons learned for you.</li>
						 <li>Competitor information, such as: site statistics, demographics, and keyword strategies, may be discovered utilizing 
						 the provided tools (properly citing sources as necessary).</li>
						 <li>Write a paragraph that summarizing your analysis of our client's competition.</li>
