				<h2>Site Intent</h2>
					<p>
					Cleaning up the code is one of the most important priorities
					of redesigning the site. The second is utilizing Gestalt principles in the site, especially in the text elements.
					  The third priority will be the performance of the site. The site contains unnecessary elements that slow down its loading times 
					  even though the site is extremely simple. The site's graphic optimization needs to be significantly reworked to accomplish this. Next is implementing forms directly
					 into the site so that clients do not have to print documents, fill them out, and turn them into the veterinary office. From experience,
					 I know that veterinary clinics must keep records for at least 7 years. This would be so much easier if this data were stored on the
					 computer. The last category is responsiveness. Many people use their mobile devices when trying to find a business. Since this is
					 a hospital, it is even more important that people are able to find the business quickly from their mobile devices.
					</p>
					<h3>Code</h3>
					<p>
					Reworking the code is not going to be a simple task. Much of the site contains unnecessary javascript elements that can be replaced by CSS.
					Replacing these elements will resolve some of the performance issues, but not all of them. The site has 5 errors while validating that
					I plan to fix. I expected many more when I entered it into the validation site. The code is also older. HTML 5 and CSS3 would greatly
					benefit this site. The final aspect to correct is the spacing and indentation issues. The code is very hard to read through efficiently.
					</p>
					<h3>Gestalt Principles</h3>
					<p>
					The five Gestalt principles that I am going to focus on are similarity, proximity, continuity, and closure. I need to change most of these elements
					in this site. I'll start with similarity. As I clicked through the separate links, a red flag went off. The pages looked different!
					I would fix this with simple design elements that tie together with proximity. Each page would contain this style of aesthetics. The other
					thing that is lacking is continuity. The eye jumps all over the page making it confusing for the user at first. I will fix this with a top-left
					approach. The heading will stick out, drawing the eye there. For closure, I am going to create boxes for different subjects that don't
					quite touch, but have a good proximity.
					</p>
					<h3>Performance and Image Optimization</h3>
					<p>
					I think much of the performance issues come from the embedded javascript. The slideshows are unnecessary and are much too small
					when compared to other elements. I think this could be replaced by a gallery page or even a CSS slideshow that is clickable and
					doesn't play automatically. The images in the site need to be optimized for responsiveness. For example, I will retrace the logo
					with the pen tool in AI and make it a PNG so it can scale for larger monitors. It looks very pixelated on my 27" iMac.
					</p>
					<h3>Integrated Forms</h3>
					<p>
					The current site tries to encourage its prospective clients to print off and bring in forms to the veterinary clinic for processing.
					I will improve this process by building HTML forms that the clients can fill out online so they can be stored in the computer. This
					will make it easier on the clients and the veterinary clinic to keep track of the forms. This registration process also allows
					the receptionist to look up the new clients instantly and schedule appointments without having to input forms.
					</p>
					<h3>Responsiveness</h3>
					<p>
					Responsiveness is a very important aspect of this site. As I stated in the introductory paragraph, it is vital that clients are
					able to access the site from their mobile devices to find the veterinary hospital in an emergency. It is also a great way for
					people to just find a new veterinary clinic if they aren't happy with their current vet, or if they currently don't have a
					vet.

				<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
					<h3>Breakdown</h3>
					<p>
					Alexa.com wasn't able to gather enough data to put together a typical client profile so I had to do a little research. First,
					I researched the most common pet in the United States. According to the 2007 U.S. Pet Ownership & Demographics Sourcebook, 
					the dog is the most popular among household owners. This is a start in 
					narrowing down the profile. The most popular dog breed in America according to the AKC is the Labrador Retriever, followed by the German Shepherd, and then
					the Golden Retriever. The typical client is going to be a lab owner. From experience, pet owners for the most part aren't very educated
					about their pet. Men own dogs slightly more than woman, so the typical client is going to be a man.
					The typical client is going to need some supplemental education whether he owns a puppy or an older dog. According to smallanimalchannel.com, the average age for
					someone shopping for pet products is 47 years old. Profiling the client that we have, we can increase the age range by five years and
					say our male dog owner would be between 42 and 52 years old. He is also more likely to buy his dog gifts
					than a woman. In 2011, it was reported that the average dog owner brought his or her dog into the vet an average of 2.7 times.
					So what does this leave us for a profile?
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Male</li>
						<li>Labrador Retriever Owner</li>
						<li>Age: 42-52</li>
						<li>Needs Supplemental Education on Dog</li>
						<li>More likely to buy his pet gifts</li>
						<li>Brings dog in about 3 times a year</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					To prepare for this kind of client on the website, the website should offer educational resources for dogs and offer 
					dog products for them to buy or a link to them. If the clinic doesn't carry gifts or products, then they may have an opportunity
					to gain a sponsor by promoting a pet supply store such as PetSmart.
					</p>
					<h3>Secondary Breakdown</h3>
					<p>
					The second most common pet owner is the cat owner. According to the Humane Society, more than 50% of households that own cats, have
					more than one cat. The typical cat owner spends around $219 per year (humane society). "88% of cats are spayed
					or neutered" which would be lucrative for the veterinary hospital. The average cat owner is also between the ages
					of 42-52. The average cat owner makes $37,000 per year (petplace.com).
					</p>
					<h3>Profile 1</h3>
					<p>
					David is a 43 year old data input specialist. He makes $30,000 per year. He is married with 2 kids. He owns
					a labrador retriever and a german shepherd. He needs to be educated on each of his dogs, mainly how different
					the two breeds are from each other. His german shepherd has diet allergies that need to be addressed. He is
					also looking for information about where to buy toys for his dogs that chew his furniture. He only brings
					his dogs in once a year for a checkup.

				<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
					<p>
					When looking to gain market share, it is wise to analyze the competition and embrace (or learn from) their experience.
					Are they drawing in a demographic you would like to tap into? Are visitors spending more time in their site's pages than yours?
					Are they using keywords that you should be target as well? And, of course, any of the bad practices that are holding them back
					are great lessons learned for you.
					Competitor information, such as: site statistics, demographics, and keyword strategies, may be discovered utilizing 
					the provided tools (properly citing sources as necessary).
					Write a paragraph that summarizing your analysis of our client's competition.
