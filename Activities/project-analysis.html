			<h1>Discovery: Project Analysis</h1>
				<h2>Site Intent</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Write a paragraph that summarizes what you understand to be the intent of the newly, redesigned site. 
						How these 'goals' will be achieved? (Proper use of terminology and/or concepts from previous HCI, production, 
						and design courses is expected).</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
					</p>
				<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>When looking to gain market share, it is wise to analyze the competition and embrace (or learn from) their experience.
						 Are they drawing in a demographic you would like to tap into? Are visitors spending more time in their site's pages than yours?
						 Are they using keywords that you should be target as well? And, of course, any of the bad practices that are holding them back
						 are great lessons learned for you.</li>
						 <li>Competitor information, such as: site statistics, demographics, and keyword strategies, may be discovered utilizing 
						 the provided tools (properly citing sources as necessary).</li>
						 <li>Write a paragraph that summarizing your analysis of our client's competition.</li>
					</ol>
				<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>When thinking about a website's user, it's common to over-generalize who is 
						visiting the site. The more narrow the target, the more efficiently (and oftentimes more correctly)
						 decisions are made. Providing the client with Use Case Scenarios where two or more types of users 
						 are identified and a specific user-workflow is described is one way to lay the groundwork for Ui decision making.</li>
						<li>In a paragraph, or two, describe the targeted user group(s) and what you would expect their potential 
						needs/workflow would be.</li>
					</ol>
